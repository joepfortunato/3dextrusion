1.  This can be done rather easily through the current implementation.  I have stored all of the points in a 2D vector so it is just a matter of running through all of the points and putting them in a file.  All of the vectors in the 2D vector are of the same length so it should be easy to write this neatly to a file. When the faces are rendered they are done so in the face index order so it is just a matter of writing to a file at the same time the faces are being created.  The color and normals are done at the same time so the same process would work.

2. C(0.8) should be between (9,1) and (10,5). deCasteljau finds C(0.8) by using the recurrence relation Pi,j = (1-u)Pi-1,j + uPi-1,j+1 where i = 1, 2, ..., n and j = 0, 1, ..., n-1.

3. When rotating a 2D square curve, it produces a 3D triangle shape with a hole in the middle (if the square is not drawn against the axis).  Once fully smoothed out, this shape produces a torus.  The same thing will result from a square with no internal control points.  This is because those control points will be added on the first subdivision.  It may be a slightly different shape since the control points move depending on the ones that surround them, but it should be the same basic shape. I tested this using my program and the results confirmed this.

4. I believe that my algorithm can already handle creating objects with holes in them like tori and vases.  For instance, making a circle and then rotating it creates a 3D triangle shape that can then be smoothed out into a torus.  The same stands for trying to make a vase by drawing a 3D L shape with the bottom going towards the axis of symmetry.
